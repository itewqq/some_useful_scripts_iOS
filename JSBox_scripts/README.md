# About PhDownloader.js

## This is a semi-finished downloader based on JSBox for the iOS users who wants to download their favorite pornhub videos. 

### How to use:  
>Add this code to your JSBox plugin, open the page where you want to download the video in the browser, then click the Share button to select JSBox and select the script. You will then see a dynamic circle showing the progress of the download. Once the download is complete you can copy the video to the player you want to use or send it to someone else.

### Attention！
>I just did a little work and haven't improved the user experience yet. You cannot **abort the download after the download starts**, unless the application is forcibly stopped. Maybe I will consider adding a cancel button later, but I am a little busy recently.
